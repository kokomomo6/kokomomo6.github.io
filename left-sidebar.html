									<h1><center>Sports Day Composition</h1></center>
 <p style="text-align: right;">24th September, 2015</p>
<p>Dear Lucy,</p>
  How are you? I'm doing great! I participated in the Annual School Sports day recently. It was held on 8th September. It was quite strange for the sports day to be held so early, but I can't blame anyone for that.

  It was held in the Sham Sui Po Sports Ground at 8:00 am. Since I'm not very familiar with that area, I teamed up with my friends to go there. It was very sunny on that day, and when I arrived it was already crowded with people. I sat down. The sun was shining brightly. The sunlight was aiming right at my face, and I had to squint in order to see properly. <p>Soon, the event started and we had the charity walk. After that, we returned to the stand and cheered for our houses. It was very tiring and not very enjoyable, but we had to do it anyway.</p> <p>Soon, it was my turn to run but I predicted that I would lose. I'm not very good at sports. Boy, I was right. I came fourth in my heat. After the race, I went back to my seat and kept on cheering despite still being out of breath. I cheered and yelled until it was finally lunchtime. The senior form students had already pre-ordered lunch for us, so we didn't have to worry about lunch. After lunch, the races continued and the event that people most looked forward to finally came--- the 4x100 metres house relay race. Our house kept getting either first or second, and we were all very fired up by this. 

  At the end of the day, there was the prize giving ceremony. I smelt victory... for St. Lucy's house. Although we did not get any prizes, I still had a good time.
<p style="text-align: right;">Love,
Constance</p>

<h1><center> My New Tutor </h1></center>


                <p>Since my mathematics is so weak, my mother hired a tutor to help me. Today was the day when I had my first lesson. I sat on the couch, waiting for him to come. Suddenly, I heard footsteps coming near my flat. I gulped down my nervousness. The sound of his footsteps was coming closer and closer… Then it came to a halt. He pressed the doorbell. I slowly dragged myself to the door, and opened it.<p>


                 <p>There he was, standing at our doorstep. He was about six foot tall, with shiny, ebony hair and a sharp piercing pair of dark brown eyes. He gazed down at me.</P>


                  <p>"Oh, no! He doesn't look like a tutor at all!" I thought to myself. In fact, he looked like a gangster. I put on the best smile I could manage and greeted him.<p>

                 <p>'P-Please come i-in.' I stuttered, and took a step back to let him in. He got in and looked around my house. 'Peter Lam', He introduced himself, 'Or you could call me "Mr. Lam" if you like. I would be your mathematics tutor for the time being.' 'My… My name is Constance Leung. It's n-nice to meet you. Please sit down.' I pointed to the couch which is facing the television. Then, I quickly took out all of my worksheets and homework, and the lesson started.<p>

                 <p>In the lesson, he did not smile, but he did not frown, or have any facial expressions at all. It made me a little bit uncomfortable. At the end of the lesson, he bid me goodbye and left. I immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Oh, but I will still have lessons with him every Monday and Friday! Why did mum hire somebody like him to teach me?</p>

                <p>Today, my mathematics teacher announced that there would be a test on the upcoming Monday. It certainly wasn't good news for me since the test would be about multiplying and dividing. Those were the two topics that I was most weak in! What if I failed in my test? I bet my tutor would slaughter me! I told him about the test, but he did not seem shocked or surprised. He just nodded his head and began revising with me. Somehow, I felt more confident about my test after he had revised with me.<p>

                 <p>I thought that I aced my test, but apparently, I did not. Instead, I got fifty nine in my test! I felt all my pride and glory vanish in a mere second. Today was a Friday, and that meant another lesson with that 'devil'. I flinched at the thought of him murdering me. He appeared with a bland face as usual, and with a monotone voice, asking me the question that would determine my life or death. </P>
 
                <p>'How was your test?'</p>

                <p>I felt a lump in my throat, and hung my head in shame. 'I-I… I got fifty nine marks…'<p>

                <p>Silence.</p>

                <p>I waited for about a minute for him to answer, but he did not. I glanced at him, but his eyes were overshadowed by his bangs. Finally, he spoke. 'I see.' He then lifted his face and raised a small smile. 'Huh?' I asked. 'Aren't you going to slaughter me or anything?' 'No, you silly girl.You've improved a lot! You got zeros in your tests before, and now you almost passed! That's big improvement!' He then sat down on the couch. 'Come on, let's take a look at your test!'</p>

                <p>My jaw dropped. "I'm still alive!" And… And he actually smiled! It was a miracle! I quickly regained my composure, and began revising with him. This time, he actually had facial expressions, and had completely buried his poker face! Finally, he bid me goodbye and left. I guess having him as my tutor isn't that bad after all. I was ignorant to judge him by his cover. Oh, I can't wait to have another lesson with him!</p>
				<h1><center>My favorite cartoon character </h1></center>
				<p>

  When people talk about cartoons, the first thing that comes to my mind is that blue, robotic cat- Doraemon.</p>
  <p>Doraemon is a robotic cat created in the future. It originally had yellow fur and a pair of ears. The original Doraemon was very cheeky, and looked down on everyone else. His dream was to become the best robot cat, but he was stuck with his quest- to help the almost helpless Nobita, a young boy. Nobita's life is full of misery and bad luck. That's why Doraemon has to help Nobita with his life. But the original Doraemon was too cheeky to help him.</p>
  <p>One day, when Doraemon was sleeping, a mouse crept into his house, and bit his ears off. When he woke up, he discovered that his ears were missing. He was so in shock and frustrated that he cried a stream of tears, and his fur turned blue because of his tears. Now Doraemon is stuck with no ears and blue fur for the rest of his life. Nobody could tell what animal he is because of his original, already odd design- with a big, round face and two large eyes, a bright shiny red nose, a collar on its neck with a golden bell, which is used for calling other cats to come to him. Instead of paws, he has magnetic hands, which are used for picking up things. His tail is short with a small, red ball on the end of the tail. His tail is actually his off switch, and when you pull it, he will shut down. And last but not least, he has a kangaroo- like pouch on its tummy. Doraemon can pull his magical items out of the pouch, such as the 'anywhere door' and 'time machine'.</p>
  <p>So how, you might ask, did he turn from a cheeky, little brat to a lovely, robotic cat? Well, the Doraemon nowadays realized that he had to tell the cheeky Doraemon what its purpose is, so he decided to use the time machine to return to the day he was created, and tell the cheeky Doraemon about his future, but the cheeky Doraemon refused to believe his future, stating that the nice Doraemon had no ears and had strange, blue fur. The nice Doraemon was outraged by this and challenged the cheeky Doraemon to a battle. In the end, the nice Doraemon won and the cheeky one was sent to a toy store. The cheeky one made friends with other toys and became nice in the end. He eventually went to Nobita's home to live with him. They went through a lot together, but that's a different story.</p>
<p>I have watched Doraemon since I was a kid. I like Doraemon because he knows that he was wrong and is willing to change. Although I like watching this series, I'm afraid that I'll no longer continue watching it because I'll grow up one day and stop watching cartoons.</p>
